## Example

The stores listing component is intended to provide an easy way to navigate through a retailer's 
list of stores. For retailers with locations in multiple states, it provides a tabbed list of stages so 
consumers are able to easily navigate to the state they are interested in.

<div class="bd-example">
{% include examples/stores/_stores-list-example.html %}
</div>
{% highlight html %}
{% include examples/stores/_stores-list-lite-example.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
