## Goals

The primary goal is to improve the capabilities of Webstop's
front-end design system to enable our developers to write more
flexible, reliable, and consistent front-end code.

The second goal is to build a design system that is back-end
agnostic, and easily portable to diverse environments. This
allows modern environments based on technologies like
Ruby on Rails, and Ember.js, and even legacy environments like
Lasso, to share a common set of front-end components. It
enables us to have a consistent styling and behavior across all
our diverse environments.

We have incorporated may of the industries latest best practices
and applied them to our environment.

                    <p>
                        The front-end component is a powerful design pattern for building front-end objects. The component pattern adds a level of reliability and confidence in your stylesheets you wouldn't have otherwise.

                        Style Guide Driven Development is an approach which places a living style guide a the heart of
                        the front-end development process. This approach produces more reliable, portable, and well
                        documented front-end pattern libraries.
