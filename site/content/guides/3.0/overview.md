## Goals

The primary goal is to improve the capabilities of Webstop's 
front-end design system to enable our developers to write more 
flexible, reliable, and consistent front-end code.

The second goal is to build a design system that is back-end 
agnostic, and easily portable to diverse environments. This 
allows modern environments based on technologies like 
Ruby on Rails, and Ember.js, and even legacy environments like 
Lasso, to share a common set of front-end components. It 
enables us to have a consistent styling and behavior across all 
our diverse environments. 

We have incorporated may of the industries latest best practices 
and applied them to our environment.


## Explore: The Basics

The follow three guides will arm you with the information you'll 
need to get the most out of your design system.

      <p>
        The component pattern is the basis of our front-end framework. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The front-end component is a powerful design pattern for building 
        front-end objects. The component pattern adds a level of reliability 
        and confidence in your stylesheets you wouldn't have otherwise.

      <p>
        Our design system is setup to support Style Guide Driven Development (SGDD). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Style Guide Driven Development is an approach which places a living style guide a the heart of the front-end development process. This approach produces more reliable, portable, and well documented front-end pattern libraries.

      <p>
        Now you've read about our approach to front-end components, and using 
        the Style Guide Drive Development methodology. This guide is less esoteric, 
        it is more pragmatic as it gets into the nuts and 
        bolts of how to use the style guide on a day-to-day basis.
